I am a freelance workflow consultant & tool UX designer. In the past I have worked as a full time tool designer in the AAA games industry on the ‘Glacier 2’ editor on which the Hitman series is built, where I was present for the end of Hitman 1 and the beginning of Hitman 2. I was also a tool designer on the ‘Decima’ editor on which the Horizon series was built, where I was present for the end of The Frozen Wilds, and the beginning of The Forbidden West.  I have also consulted for Unity asset store level editors.

I also spent a few years working at Apple on AR creation tools such as Reality Composer and Reality Converter, which has made me well acquainted with Pixar’s USD framework.

Next to that, I created and organize the Tool Design Roundtables at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in San Francisco, talk at conferences around the world and I have contributed a chapter about Tool Design in the book ‘An Architectural Approach to Level Design, Second Edition’.
